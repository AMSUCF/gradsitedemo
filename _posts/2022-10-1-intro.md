This course provides an introduction to the PhD in Texts and Technology. Throughout this course, we will explore Texts & Technology through theory and practice, with an emphasis on interdisciplinarity, understanding academic fields and their relationships to each other, developing an academic identity, and fundamentals of success for both graduate school and academia. Each week will include a combination of readings, exercises, discussions, and progress towards a draft journal article and professional academic web presence. PR: Graduate standing or C.I.

- **Weekly Readings and Lecture.** The full schedule of required readings is listed in the syllabus: additional recommended readings will be provided in each module. Weekly lectures and discussion will take place in the classroom: however, Zoom attendance is available for those who need it.

- **Online Activities.** This course requires substantial independent work: as part of the mixed-mode structure, additional lectures and tutorials will be available through Webcourses, with an emphasis on the iterative development of the semester projects.
